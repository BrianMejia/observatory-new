# Templates
The files in this folder are the HTML templates that will be rendered using
[Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) to form the pages of the site.
Pages are mostly plain HTML but also use the Jinja2 style syntax for templating.
Check Askama's documentation for more info.

Pages are organized in the same manner as the Rust code is, logically by
purpose with related pages in the same folder.
